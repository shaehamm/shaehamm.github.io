Hello! As you may have guessed my name is Shae Hamm.

I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2017 with a BS in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) and a Certificate in Environmental Studies. In 2020, I decided to switch careers and graduated from [The Software Guild's](https://www.thesoftwareguild.com/coding-bootcamps/java-training/) Java bootcamp.

> Why did I decide on programming?

At UW-Madison, I took an Introduction to Java class as well as Problem Solving Using Computers, since programming knowledge was required to get a degree in AOS. I thouroughly enjoyed the Java class but at the time was set on my career path. It wasn't until I had a job in my field that I realized AOS is not a good career fit for me.

Looking back at my programming experience from UW-Madison and having friends in developer positions already helped me come to the conclusion that learning to code would be a great step toward my career goal. After completing the 2020 Java cohert with The Software Guild, I can say I've made the right decision. I look forward to what my future holds as a developer and the continued learning experiences that come with it!
